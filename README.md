# Category Theory for Programmers, solutions to the exercises.
Here I will write all my solutions to the challenges given in the book Category Theory for Programmers, Scala edition.

I will try to use Scala 3 as my main language but because many solutions in this book are already written in it, I will try to give my own solutions to the challenges as well as give other solutions in Python 3 if necessary.
